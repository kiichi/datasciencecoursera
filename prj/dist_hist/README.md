Histgram and MDS
=============================

* This is batch process for png generation
* Histgram
* MDS and Distance mapping
* Each dataset contains the list of patients that one doctor handled per month
* Good example of bimodal histogram and you will see 2 clusters for each doctor.
This could be because they do first round and second round in 24 hours? See those
