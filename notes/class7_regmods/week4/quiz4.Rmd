###Q1


```
stability
stable positioning or not (stab / xstab).
error
size of error (MM / SS / LX / XL).
sign
sign of error, positive or negative (pp / nn).
wind
wind sign (head / tail).
magn
wind strength (Light / Medium / Strong / Out of Range).
vis
visibility (yes / no).
use
use the autolander or not. (auto / noauto.)
```

Consider the space shuttle data ?shuttle in the MASS library. Consider modeling the use of the autolander as the outcome (variable name use). 

Fit a logistic regression model with autoloader (variable auto) use (labeled as "auto" 1) versus not (0) as predicted by wind sign (variable wind). 

Give the estimated odds ratio for autoloader use comparing head winds, labeled as "head" in the variable headwind (numerator) to tail winds (denominator).


```{r}
library(MASS)
head(shuttle)

shuttle2<-shuttle
shuttle2$use2<-as.numeric(shuttle2$use=='auto')
#shuttle2$wind2<-as.numeric(shuttle2$wind=='head')
#head(shuttle2)
fit<-glm(use2 ~ factor(wind) - 1, family = binomial, data = shuttle2)

#0.03181

#fit<-glm(use ~ wind, family = binomial, data = shuttle)
#anova(fit)
summary(fit)$coef
exp(coef(fit))
1.286 / 1.327
#exp(0.25131)
#exp(0.03181)
exp(cbind(OddsRatio = coef(fit), confint(fit)))
```

###Q2

Consider the previous problem. Give the estimated odds ratio for autoloader use comparing head winds (numerator) to tail winds (denominator) adjusting for wind strength from the variable magn.

```{r}
fit<-glm(use2 ~ factor(wind) + factor(magn) - 1, family = binomial, data = shuttle2)
summary(fit)$coef
exp(coef(fit))
exp(cbind(OddsRatio = coef(fit), confint(fit)))
1.4384/1.4852
```

###Q3

```{r}
fit<-glm(use2 ~ factor(wind), family = binomial, data = shuttle2)
summary(fit)$coef

fit<-glm(1 - use2 ~ factor(wind), family = binomial, data = shuttle2)
summary(fit)$coef
```



###Q4

Consider the insect spray data InsectSprays. Fit a Poisson model using spray as a factor level. Report the estimated relative rate comapring spray A (numerator) to spray B (denominator).

```{r}
fit<-glm(count~factor(spray)-1,data=InsectSprays,family=poisson)
summary(fit)$coef
exp(coef(fit))
14.500  / 15.333
```



###Q5

Consider a Poisson glm with an offset, t. So, for example, a model of the form glm(count ~ x + offset(t), family = poisson) where x is a factor variable comparing a treatment (1) to a control (0) and t is the natural log of a monitoring time. 

What is impact of the coefficient for x if we fit the model glm(count ~ x + offset(t2), family = poisson) where t2 <- log(10) + t? 

In other words, what happens to the coefficients if we change the units of the offset variable. (Note, adding log(10) on the log scale is multiplying by 10 on the original scale.)


```{r}
fit<-glm(count ~ factor(spray), family = poisson,data=InsectSprays,offset = log(count + 1))
summary(fit)$coef
fit2<-glm(count ~ factor(spray), family = poisson,data=InsectSprays,offset = log(10)+log(count+1))
summary(fit2)$coef


fit<-glm(count ~ factor(spray) + offset(log(count+1)), family = poisson,data=InsectSprays)
summary(fit)$coef
fit2<-glm(count ~ factor(spray) + offset(log(10)+log(count+1)), family = poisson,data=InsectSprays)
summary(fit2)$coef
```

basically, b1 did not change. Same rate, 0.003512 in both equation.


###Q6


Using a knot point at 0, fit a linear model that looks like a hockey stick with two lines meeting at x=0. Include an intercept term, x and the knot point term. What is the estimated slope of the line after 0?

```{r}
x <- -5:5
y <- c(5.12, 3.93, 2.67, 1.87, 0.52, 0.08, 0.93, 2.05, 2.54, 3.87, 4.97)


knots<-c(0)
splineTerms<-sapply(knots,function(knot) (x>knot)*(x-knot))
xmat<-cbind(1,x,splineTerms)
fit<-lm(y~xmat-1)
yhat<-predict(fit)

summary(fit)$coef
(yhat[10]-yhat[6])/4

plot(x,y)
lines(x,yhat,col="red")

```
