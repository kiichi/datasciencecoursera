#### Beta Function
See http://www.xycoon.com/beta.htm
```{r}
# Triangle Shape  where 75 percentile is
pbeta(0.75, 2, 1)
# Flat Horiz Line where 75 percentile is
pbeta(0.75, 1, 1)
```





###A random variable

takes the value -4 with probability .2 and 1 with probability .8. What is the variance of this random variable?
```{r}
(-4)^2*0.2 + (1^2)*0.8
```

###Probability Mass Function - What's the Variace?
```{r}
p <- c(.1, .2, .3, .4)
x <- 2:5 
sum(x^2*p)-sum(x*p)^2
```

###Sum of PMF (Probability Mass Function)

```{r}
x <- 1:4
p <- x/sum(x)
temp <- rbind(x, p)
rownames(temp) <- c("X", "Prob")
temp
sum(p*x)
1.0*0.1 + 2.0*0.2 + 3.0*0.3 + 4.0*0.4
```
